    <p>
      Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth met as designers for Michael Bierut at the New York office of Pentagram Design, where they both spent the last three years as associate partners. In 2014, Reed and Smyth launched a Kickstarter campaign to reissue the 1970 NYCTA Graphics Standards Manual designed by Unimark International, specifically Massimo Vingelli and Bob Noorda. After a highly successful campaign raising over $800,000 in funding, the two decided to establish Standards Manual as a publishing imprint. To date, the company has released four titles—including the NASA Graphics Standards Manual and American Revolution Bicentennial Graphics Standards Manual—selling 30,000+ books.

    <p>
      In January of 2017 the two had left Pentagram and established a new design consultancy, Order. While the company is still in its early days, the goal is to maintain a broad range of clients similar to their experiences working under Bierut. In addition to client work, an initiative to provide communication materials for small non-profits and NGOs is planned as a primary objective. This would involve traveling to cities in the United States where design resources are limited, and providing materials that these organizations can put in place to better serve their mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesse and Hamish will speak about the spontaneity of collaboration and how a small project turned into a full time partnership—both in regards to Standards Manual and eventually Order—as well as the importance of historical preservation and not following the tech trend.
